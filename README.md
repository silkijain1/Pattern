**Turtle Spiral Pattern using Python**

This is a simple and visually appealing **spiral pattern** created using **Python's Turtle Graphics module**. It’s a great beginner project to help you learn basic programming concepts like loops, angles, and drawing with the Turtle library.

**📌 Project Overview**

The script uses Python’s built-in `turtle` module to draw a colorful spiral design. It sets the drawing speed to fast, chooses a background color (black), and uses cyan for the spiral lines. A while loop is used to draw decreasing arcs, which gives the appearance of a rotating spiral.

This is a fun way to get started with creative coding and understand how loops and graphics work together in Python.

**🧰 Requirements**

* Python 3.x (No extra installation needed — `turtle` comes with Python)

**📝 What You’ll Learn**

* Using loops in Python
* Turtle graphics basics (`forward`, `left`, `color`, etc.)
* Creating art through code
